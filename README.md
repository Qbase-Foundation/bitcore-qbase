Work in Progress - Not Yet Functional
=======

This is Traysi's fork of Bitpay's Bitcore/Under's Ravencore for Ritocoin. It has a limited segwit support.

----
Getting Started
=====================================
Deploying Ritocore full-stack manually:
----
````
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install curl git python3 make build-essential libzmq3-dev python2.7
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

#restart your shell/os

nvm install 10.5.0
nvm use 10.5.0

#install mongodb
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2930ADAE8CAF5059EE73BB4B58712A2291FA4AD5
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/3.6 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.6.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
sudo systemctl enable mongod.service

#install qbasecore
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python
git clone https://github.com/traysi/qbasecore.git
cd qbasecore && git checkout master
npm install -g --production
````
Copy the following into a file named qbasecore-node.json and place it in ~/.qbasecore/ (be sure to customize username values(without angle brackets<>) and/or ports)
````json
{
  "network": "livenet",
  "port": 3001,
  "services": [
    "qbased",
    "web",
    "insight-api",
    "insight-ui"
  ],
  "allowedOriginRegexp": "^https://<yourdomain>\\.<yourTLD>$",
  "messageLog": "",
  "servicesConfig": {
    "web": {
      "disablePolling": true,
      "enableSocketRPC": false
    },
    "insight-ui": {
      "routePrefix": "",
      "apiPrefix": "api"
    },
    "insight-api": {
      "routePrefix": "api",
      "coinTicker" : "https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/qbasecoin/?convert=USD",
      "coinShort": "RITO",
	    "db": {
		  "host": "127.0.0.1",
		  "port": "27017",
		  "database": "qbase-api-livenet",
		  "user": "",
		  "password": ""
	  }
    },
    "qbased": {
      "sendTxLog": "/home/<yourusername>/.qbasecore/pushtx.log",
      "spawn": {
        "datadir": "/home/<yourusername>/.qbasecore/data",
        "exec": "/home/<yourusername>/qbasecore/node_modules/qbasecore-node/bin/qbased",
        "rpcqueue": 1000,
        "rpcport": 13741,
        "zmqpubrawtx": "tcp://127.0.0.1:28332",
        "zmqpubhashblock": "tcp://127.0.0.1:28332"
      }
    }
  }
}
````
Quick note on allowing socket.io from other services. 
- If you would like to have a seperate services be able to query your api with live updates, remove the "allowedOriginRegexp": setting and change "disablePolling": to false. 
- "enableSocketRPC" should remain false unless you can control who is connecting to your socket.io service. 
- The allowed OriginRegexp does not follow standard regex rules. If you have a subdomain, the format would be(without angle brackets<>):
````
"allowedOriginRegexp": "^https://<yoursubdomain>\\.<yourdomain>\\.<yourTLD>$",
````

To setup unique mongo credentials:
````
mongo
>use qbase-api-livenet
>db.createUser( { user: "test", pwd: "test1234", roles: [ "readWrite" ] } )
>exit
````
(then add these unique credentials to your qbasecore-node.json)

Copy the following into a file named qbase.conf and place it in ~/.qbasecore/data
````json
server=1
whitelist=127.0.0.1
txindex=1
addressindex=1
timestampindex=1
spentindex=1
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
zmqpubhashblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
rpcport=13741
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcuser=qbasecoin
rpcpassword=local321 #change to something unique
uacomment=qbasecore-sl

mempoolexpiry=72 # Default 336
rpcworkqueue=1100
maxmempool=2000
dbcache=1000
maxtxfee=1.0
dbmaxfilesize=64
````
Launch your copy of qbasecore:
````
qbasecored
````
You can then view the Ritocoin block explorer at the location: `http://localhost:3001`

Create an Nginx proxy to forward port 80 and 443(with a snakeoil ssl cert)traffic:
----
IMPORTANT: this "nginx-qbasecore" config is not meant for production use
see this guide [here](https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/) for production usage
````
sudo apt-get install -y nginx ssl-cert
````
copy the following into a file named "nginx-qbasecore" and place it in /etc/nginx/sites-available/
````
server {
    listen 80;
    listen 443 ssl;
        
    include snippets/snakeoil.conf;
    root /home/qbasecore/www;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/qbasecore-access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/qbasecore-error.log;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_connect_timeout 10;
        proxy_send_timeout 10;
        proxy_read_timeout 100; # 100s is timeout of Cloudflare
        send_timeout 10;
    }
    location /robots.txt {
       add_header Content-Type text/plain;
       return 200 "User-agent: *\nallow: /\n";
    }
    location /qbasecore-hostname.txt {
        alias /var/www/html/qbasecore-hostname.txt;
    }
}
````
Then enable your site:
````
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nginx-qbasecore /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d
sudo printf "[Service]\nExecStartPost=/bin/sleep 0.1\n" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/override.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart nginx
````
Upgrading Ritocore full-stack manually:
----

- This will leave the local blockchain copy intact:
Shutdown the qbasecored application first, and backup your unique qbase.conf and qbasecore-node.json
````
cd ~/
rm -rf .npm .node-gyp qbasecore
rm .qbasecore/data/qbase.conf .qbasecore/qbasecore-node.json

#reboot

git clone https://github.com/traysi/qbasecore.git
cd qbasecore && git checkout lightweight
npm install -g --production
````
(recreate your unique qbase.conf and qbasecore-node.json)

- This will redownload a new blockchain copy:
(Some updates may require you to reindex the blockchain data. If this is the case, redownloading the blockchain only takes 20 minutes)
Shutdown the qbasecored application first, and backup your unique qbase.conf and qbasecore-node.json
````
cd ~/
rm -rf .npm .node-gyp qbasecore
rm -rf .qbasecore

#reboot

git clone https://github.com/traysi/qbasecore.git
cd qbasecore && git checkout lightweight
npm install -g --production
````
(recreate your unique qbase.conf and qbasecore-node.json)

Undeploying Ritocore full-stack manually:
----
````
nvm deactivate
nvm uninstall 10.5.0
rm -rf .npm .node-gyp qbasecore
rm .qbasecore/data/qbase.conf .qbasecore/qbasecore-node.json
mongo
>use qbase-api-livenet
>db.dropDatabase()
>exit
````
